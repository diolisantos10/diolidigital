Example
Create an ad group

Use this endpoint to create an ad group. At the ad group level, you can configure placement, audience settings (see Ad Targeting), budget, schedules, as well as bidding and optimization options for ads. To learn about the procedure and the essential data fields to create an ad group, see Create an Ad Group.

Before you migrate your calls to v1.3, please see Migrate campaign management APIs to learn about the highlighted differences between v1.2 and v1.3 campaign management APIs.

To learn about the mapping between TikTok Ads Manager (TTAM) features at the campaign, ad group, and ad levels and the corresponding API configurations, see Mapping between campaign features on TikTok Ads Manager and API configurations.

Note
If you have specified special_industries at the campaign level, ensure that ad groups in the campaign meet the targeting requirements outlined in Targeting requirements for ad groups in a campaign with special ad categories.

Ad groups for iOS 14 Dedicated Campaigns

For an iOS 14 dedicated campaign, you can have up to 2 active ad groups. To create the ad group for an iOS 14 Dedicated Campaign, set the ios14_targeting field to IOS14_PLUS, which stands for devices where the iOS privacy updates have been enforced. You can see the iOS 14 Dedicated Campaign guide here.

This field is supported under the following conditions:
The category of Housing, Employment, or Credit (specical_industries) is NOT specified in your campaign.
AND the advertising objective (objective_type) is NOT Product Sales (PRODUCT_SALES) in your campaign.
AND TikTok placement is selected in your ad group (i.e., placement_type is set as PLACEMENT_TYPE_AUTOMATIC or placement_type is set as PLACEMENT_TYPE_NORMAL and PLACEMENT_TIKTOK is included in placements).

Saved Audience ID.
Before using this field, call /dmp/saved_audience/create/ to create a Saved Audience and get the Saved Audience ID in response. The advertiser ID associated with your Saved Audience should be the same as the advertiser ID in your ad group. Otherwise, an error will occur.
If you use saved_audience_id to create an ad group, we will return both the Saved Audience ID and the targeting options that are included within your Saved Audience in response.
See Create a Saved Audience to find out the detailed workflow and code examples.

Note:
When creating a Saved Audience via /dmp/saved_audience/create/, you can specify targeting options such as gender. However, if you are creating an ad group using a Saved Audience, you must avoid concurrently setting both the saved_audience_id and targeting options (like gender) already within your Saved Audience. Otherwise, an error will occur.
If the device setting of your Saved Audience is in conflict with the device settings of the ad group, an error will occur. Examples include:
When the operating system for your Saved Audience is Android, but while creating an ad group, you set ios14_targeting as IOS14_PLUS.
When you specify APP_PROMOTION as the objective_type field at the campaign level and use the App ID of an Android App in your ad group, yet your Saved Audience's operating system is iOS.
If your API request throws an error that is associated with a conflict between your Saved Audience configurations and ad group configurations, the current error message will indicate that the issue pertains to your audience targeting option. To resolve this, we recommend using /dmp/saved_audience/list/ to check the details of the corresponding targeting option to identify the source of the problem and then create a new Saved Audience if necessary.
If the saved_audience_id was created with age_groups specified, the age restriction rules outlined in New age restrictions for ads on TikTok for different advertising objectives also apply. Make sure that the age targeting setting is allowed before you use the Saved Audience (saved_audience_id ) in the ad group.

placement_type is PLACEMENT_TYPE_NORMAL with placements as ["PLACEMENT_TIKTOK"], or placement_type is PLACEMENT_TYPE_AUTOMATIC
Existing "Install with in-app event" ad groups on TikTok placement will not be affected. Additionally, Pangle placement and Global App Bundle placement (where placement_type is PLACEMENT_TYPE_NORMAL and placements includes only PLACEMENT_PANGLE or PLACEMENT_GLOBAL_APP_BUNDLE or both) will not be impacted.
