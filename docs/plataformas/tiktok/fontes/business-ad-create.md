Create ads

Use this endpoint to upload your ad creatives (pictures, videos, texts, call-to-action) and create a regular ad. For different placements, the creative formats and requirements are different. Upload your ad creatives according to the placement requirements. See here to learn about how to create regular ads.

Important
Creating non-Spark Ads using Custom Identities in ad groups that deliver to Automatic Placement or Select Placement when TikTok is included is no longer supported for existing ad accounts. All new ad accounts created on or after January 15, 2026 cannot create non-Spark Ads using Custom Identities for these placements. Existing ads remain unaffected and editable. Ad campaigns that deliver only to Pangle or Global App Bundle placements are not be affected by Custom Identity deprecation. Learn more about changes coming to Custom Identity and migrate to Spark Ads.

Before you start

Review Campaign Creation and understand the available campaign creation use cases to know which scenario best fits your integration.

Each ad group can have up to 20 or 50 regular ads.

If the advertising objective of the campaign that the ad group belongs to is RF_REACH, the ad group can include at most 20 ads.
If the advertising objective of the campaign that the ad group belongs to is PRODUCT_SALES, the ad group can include at most 20 ads (when campaign_product_source is STORE) or 50 ads (when campaign_product_source is CATALOG).
If the advertising objective of the campaign that the ad group belongs to is not PRODUCT_SALES or RF_REACH, the ad group can include at most 50 ads.

To create Smart Creative ads, use the /ad/aco/create/ endpoint.

Before you migrate your calls to v1.3, please see Migrate campaign management APIs to learn about the highlighted differences between v1.2 and v1.3 campaign management APIs.

To learn about the mapping between TikTok Ads Manager (TTAM) features at the campaign, ad group, and ad levels and the corresponding API configurations, see Mapping between campaign features on TikTok Ads Manager and API configurations.

They consist of key-value pairs that are specified through key and value.

Max size : 14.

In VSA for Catalog scenarios:
If you use a product link in your ad (shopping_ads_fallback_type is SHOPPING_ADS), you can add URL parameters to the product link by passing utm_params. The URL parameters will be automatically appended to the product link upon ad delivery.
If you use a custom link (website URL) in your ad (shopping_ads_fallback_type is CUSTOM), you can manually add URL parameters to the custom link by directly setting landing_page_url to a URL that already includes URL parameters.
However, if you use a custom link in your ad and pass utm_params at the same time, the URL parameters will not be automatically appended to the custom link (landing_page_url) upon ad delivery. In such cases, you need to ensure that you specify a landing_page_url with the URL parameters already appended, and that utm_params exactly matches the used URL parameters. Otherwise, an error will occur.
In AIA or Automotive Ads for Models scenarios, you can add URL parameters to the product link (the landing_page_url of your catalog products) by passing utm_params. The URL parameters will be automatically appended to the product link upon ad delivery.
In other scenarios, if you set landing_page_url to a URL that already includes URL parameters, you can optionally pass utm_params at the same time to store the URL parameters used in the URL. In such cases, you need to ensure that utm_params exactly matches the used URL parameters. The URL parameters will not be automatically appended to the landing_page_url upon ad delivery.
