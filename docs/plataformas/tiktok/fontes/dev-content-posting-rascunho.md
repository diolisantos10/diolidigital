Upload a video

To initiate video upload on TikTok's servers, you must invoke the Content Posting API - Video Upload endpoint. You have the following two options:

If you have the video file locally, set the source parameter to FILE_UPLOAD in your request.
if the video is hosted on a URL, set the source parameter to PULL_FROM_URL.
Example

Example using source=FILE_UPLOAD:

Request:

curl --location 'https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/post/publish/inbox/video/init/' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer act.example12345Example12345Example' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "source_info": {
        "source": "FILE_UPLOAD",
        "video_size": exampleVideoSize,
        "chunk_size" : exampleVideoSize,
        "total_chunk_count": 1
    }
}'

Response:

200 OK

{
    "data": {
        "publish_id": "v_inbox_file~v2.123456789",
        "upload_url": "https://open-upload.tiktokapis.com/video/?upload_id=67890&upload_token=Xza123"    
    },
    "error": {
         "code": "ok",
         "message": "",
         "log_id": "202210112248442CB9319E1FB30C1073F3"
     }
}

Example using source=PULL_FROM_URL:

Request:

curl --location 'https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/post/publish/inbox/video/init/' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer act.example12345Example12345Example' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "source_info": {
        "source": "PULL_FROM_URL",
        "video_url": "https://example.verified.domain.com/example_video.mp4",
    }
}'

Response:

200 OK

{
    "data": {
        "publish_id": "v_inbox_url~v2.123456789"
    },
    "error": {
         "code": "ok",
         "message": "",
         "log_id": "202210112248442CB9319E1FB30C1073F4"
     }
}

If you are using source=FILE_UPLOAD:

Extract the upload_url and publish_id from the response data.
Send the video from your local filesystem to the extracted upload_url using a PUT request. The video processing will occur asynchronously once the upload is complete.
curl --location --request PUT 'https://open-upload.tiktokapis.com/video/?upload_id=67890&upload_token=Xza123' \
--header 'Content-Range: bytes 0-30567099/30567100' \
--header 'Content-Type: video/mp4' \
--data '@/path/to/file/example.mp4'

With the publish_id returned earlier, check for status updates using the Get Post Status endpoint.

curl --location 'https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/post/publish/status/fetch/' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer act.example12345Example12345Example' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8' \
--data '{
    "publish_id": "v_inbox_file~v2.123456789"
}'
Upload photos

To initiate photo upload on TikTok's server, you must invoke the Content Posting API endpoint.

Note:

There are differences between the photo post endpoint and the existing video post endpoint.

Use /v2/post/publish/content/init/ to upload photos instead of /v2/post/publish/inbox/video/init/
The post_mode and media_type are required parameters in request.body
There are additional parameters supported, such as title and description.
Example

Request:

curl --location 'https://open.tiktokapis.com/v2/post/publish/content/init/' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer act.example12345Example12345Example' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "post_info": {
        "title": "funny cat",
        "description": "this will be a #funny photo on your @tiktok #fyp"
    },
    "source_info": {
        "source": "PULL_FROM_URL",
        "photo_cover_index": 1,
        "photo_images": [
            "https://tiktokcdn.com/obj/example-image-01.webp",
            "https://tiktokcdn.com/obj/example-image-02.webp"
        ]
    },
    "post_mode": "MEDIA_UPLOAD",
    "media_type": "PHOTO"
}'

Response:

200 OK

{
    "data": {
        "publish_id": "p_pub_url~v2.123456789"
    },
    "error": {
         "code": "ok",
         "message": "",
         "log_id": "202210112248442CB9319E1FB30C1073F3"
     }
