Create a Manual Campaign

This article introduces how to create a campaign.

Steps

Use /campaign/create/ to create a regular campaign. You can define the following settings at the campaign level.

To understand how campaign-level features in TikTok Ads Manager correspond to API parameters, see Mapping between campaign features in TikTok Ads Manager and API configurations.

advertiser_id: ID of your ad account. You can get the ID from your TikTok For Business account.
campaign_name: A descriptive name of your campaign.
objective_type: The advertising objective of your campaign. See Advertising objectives for details.
budget_mode: The budget mode can be total (BUDGET_MODE_TOTAL), daily (BUDGET_MODE_DAY), dynamic daily (BUDGET_MODE_DYNAMIC_DAILY_BUDGET), or infinite (BUDGET_MODE_INFINITE). The budget mode can be set at the campaign level or the ad group level. See Budget for details.
budget: If budget_mode is total, daily, or dynamic daily, you need to set a budget.
budget_optimize_on: Whether you want to enable Campaign Budget Optimization (CBO). Once CBO is enabled (budget_optimize_on = TRUE), you need to set the campaign-level budget_mode and budget. Other CBO-related fields such as bid_type, deep_bid_type, optimization_goal are set at the ad group level. See Campaign Budget Optimization for details.

To find out the details of other parameters, see the /campaign/create/ article.

Example
