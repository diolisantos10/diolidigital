If this field is not passed when campaign_type is set to IOS14_CAMPAIGN, operation_status is set to DISABLE, and you have enabled SKAN 4.0 for your App, this field will default to POSTBACK_WINDOW_MODE1.
If you have enabled SKAN 4.0 for your App, ensure that you target devices running iOS 16.1 and later so that you can receive SKAN 4.0 postbacks. To only target iOS 16.1+ devices, set min_ios_version to 16.1 at the ad group level.
