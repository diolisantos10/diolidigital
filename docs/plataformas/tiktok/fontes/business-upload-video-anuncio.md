Upload a video

Use this endpoint to upload a video to the Asset Library and use the obtained video ID for creating ads.

Request timeout for this interface is 10s, and the transmission speed depends on network bandwidth. Please make sure that the file size is reasonable.

If you upload a video that already exists in the advertiser account, the API response will be the information of the existing video.

Note

We recommend that you turn on Smart Fix when uploading your videos. This API will automatically detect and fix issues in your videos, ensuring that they meet our requirements for delivery. To learn about how to enable Smart Fix, please refer to Smart Fix.
Starting April 24th, 2025, Smart Fix will limit automatic fixes only to the flaw types LOW_RESOLUTION and ILLEGAL_VIDEO_SIZE and function as follows:
Resolution adjustments:
LOW_RESOLUTION: If this issue is detected, the video is automatically enhanced to a standard resolution of 1280x720 pixels, also referred to as 720p.
ILLEGAL_VIDEO_SIZE: If this issue is detected, the video is automatically adjusted to one of the standard aspect ratios: 1:1 (square), 9:16 (vertical), or 16:9 (horizontal).
Output limitation: Only one fixed version of the video will be returned.
Naming conventions: The fixed video will be named either according to the custom name specified via the file_name parameter or following the default naming convention if no custom name is given (see the description of file_name for details).
Before you start

You need to confirm the video meets the Creative requirements for delivery before the video can be used in ads.

advertiser_id
Required
	
string
	
Advertiser ID.

file_name
	
string
	
Video name.

When Smart Fix is not enabled (flaw_detect and auto_fix_enabled are set to false):
If you upload a local file, the default name will be the original file name.
If you provide a URL, the default name will be the filename portion of the URL path.
If the original file name or the filename portion of the URL path exceeds 100 characters, it will be truncated to use only the first 100 characters.
When Smart Fix is enabled (flaw_detect and auto_fix_enabled are set to true):
The default name will be either the original file name (for a local file) or the filename portion of the URL path (for a URL). If you specify a custom video name via file_name, the file_name value will be the name of the fixed video.

Note: Videos under the same advertiser_id cannot have duplicated file names. You can call /file/name/check/ to check whether the file name has been used.
If you get an error about duplicated file names, please rename the files or append timestamps to the original file names (for example, in the format of _, and upload the videos again.

string
	
Video upload method.

Default value: UPLOAD_BY_FILE
