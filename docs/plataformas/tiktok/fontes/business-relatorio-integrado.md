Run a synchronous report

Use this endpoint to create a synchronous report task.

This endpoint can currently return the reporting data of up to 20,000 advertisements. If your number of advertisements exceeds 20,000, please use campaign_ids / adgroup_ids / ad_ids as a filter to obtain the reporting data of all advertisements in batches. If you use campaign_ids / adgroup_ids / ad_ids as a filter, you can pass in up to 100 IDs at a time.

To learn about how to run a synchronous report, see Run a synchronous report.
To find out the supported dimensions, metrics, and use cases for different report types, see Report types.
To learn about the relationship between advertising service type, report type and report data level, see Overview-Data level.
To find out answers to common questions regarding reporting, see FAQ.

Important
If you want to retrieve the reporting data of GMV Max Campaigns, run GMV Max Campaign reports for your Product GMV Max Campaigns or Live GMV Max Campaigns using /gmv_max/report/get/ instead.

Note
If you compare the synchronous report with a report downloaded from TTAM (TikTok Ads Manager）, you will discover data inconsistency because the downloaded report should be compared with its counterpart, an asynchronous report, rather than a synchronous report. Both the TTAM downloaded report and the API asynchronous report do not implement the 20,000-truncation for ads.

Method GET

Header

Field	Data Type	Description

Access-Token
Required
	
string
	
Authorized access token. For details, see Authentication.

Parameters

Field	Data Type	Description

advertiser_id
Conditional
	
string
	
You need to pass in either advertiser_id/advertiser_ids or bc_id.
When report_type is set to BASIC or AUDIENCE, pass in advertiser_id or advertiser_ids. If you pass in both advertiser_id and advertiser_ids, advertiser_id will be ignored.
When report_type is set to PLAYABLE_MATERIAL, CATALOG, or TT_SHOP, pass in advertiser_id.
When report_type is set to BC, pass in bc_id.

Advertiser ID.

advertiser_ids
conditional
	
string[]
	
When report_type is set to BASIC or AUDIENCE, you need to pass in either advertiser_id or advertiser_ids. If you pass in both advertiser_id and advertiser_ids, advertiser_id will be ignored.
Valid when report_type is BASIC or AUDIENCE.

A list of advertiser IDs.
Max size: 5.

Please be aware of the following information when working with this field:
When advertiser_ids is used, we will return up to 20,000 IDs in response. The cutoff logic for IDs is based on the creation time of campaigns, ad groups, or ads in descending order, but we cannot guarantee that each advertiser will have an evenly distributed number of IDs.
When advertiser_ids is used, the returned metrics data in the response will include currency, timezone, and advertiser_id.
Different advertisers might have different time zones. You can use multi_adv_report_in_utc_time to determine whether the data returned should be set to the UTC+0 timezone for all advertisers or set to the local timezone for each respective advertiser.
Different advertisers might have different currencies, and we will return the corresponding currency for each advertiser in the returned metrics. These metric data will be presented without a decimal point. For instance, a spend of "100 USD" will be displayed as 100 without any decimal indicator such as ".000".
If you want to view the total added-up metrics for all advertiser IDs, enable enable_total_metrics in your request. The returned total_metrics in the response will include currency, timezone, and advertiser_id, but all with a value of -.

Note:

If you use advertiser_ids but do not include any ID dimensions in the dimensions field, we will return 0 as the value for currency, timezone, and advertiser_id and - as the value of cost-related metrics, such as spend, in the metrics object of the response.
The advertisers specified in advertiser_ids should all belong to the same TikTok for Business user. Otherwise, an error will occur. Use /oauth2/advertiser/get/ to retrieve a list of advertiser IDs that belong to the same TikTok for Business user.

bc_id
Conditional
	
string
	
You need to pass in either advertiser_id/advertiser_ids or bc_id.

string
	
Not supported when report_type is BC.
Required when report_type is BASIC,AUDIENCE or CATALOG.

The data level that you'd like to query in reports.

Note:

If you specify this field as AUCTION_ADVERTISER, data of all Auction Ads and Reservation Ads under the advertiser account will be returned.
When report_type is BASIC, AUDIENCE or CATALOG:
If you set this field to AUCTION_CAMPAIGN, the data for all ads under undeleted auction campaigns will be returned, because by default the campaign_status filter is applied and defaults to STATUS_NOT_DELETE.
If you set this field to AUCTION_ADGROUP, the data for all ads under undeleted auction ad groups will be returned, because by default the adgroup_status filter is applied and defaults to STATUS_NOT_DELETE.
If you set this field to AUCTION_AD, only the data for undeleted ads under all auction campaigns will be returned, because by default the ad_status filter is applied and defaults to STATUS_NOT_DELETE.
If you want to get the data for all ads under all auction campaigns, set the ad_status filter to STATUS_ALL (filtering=[{"field_name":"ad_status","filter_type":"IN","filter_value":"[\"STATUS_ALL\"]"}]).
