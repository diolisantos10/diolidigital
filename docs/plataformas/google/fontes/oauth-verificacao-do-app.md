OAuth App Verification

Google uses OAuth 2.0 for user permissions and consent, which enables developers to specify the type, and level of access required for their app to function via strings known as API scopes. If your app uses Google APIs to access Google users’ data, it may be subject to a verification process before you publish your app.

Apps that request access to scopes categorized as sensitive or restricted must complete Google's OAuth app verification before being granted access. A complete list of Google APIs and their corresponding scopes can be found in the OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Google APIs. When you add scopes to your project, scope categories (non-sensitive, sensitive, or restricted) are indicated automatically in the Google Cloud Console.

If your app utilizes only non-sensitive scopes, it is not mandatory for your app to complete the app verification process. However, if you want your app to display an app name and logo on the OAuth consent screen, you will need to complete a lighter-weight verification process known as "brand-verification".

For detailed information on the specific verification requirements for sensitive and restricted scopes, please refer to the verification requirements section.

For detailed information on app types that are not subjected to the verification requirements refer to the "When is verification not needed" section.
