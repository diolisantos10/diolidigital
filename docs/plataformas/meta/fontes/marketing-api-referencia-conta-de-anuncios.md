Versão Graph API
v26.0
Ad Account

Represents a business, person or other entity who creates and manages ads on Facebook. Multiple people can manage an account, and each person can have one or more levels of access to an account, see Business Manager API.

In response to Apple’s new policy, we are announcing breaking changes that will affect SDKAdNetwork, Marketing API and Ads Insights API endpoints.

To learn more about how Apple’s iOS 14.5 requirements will impact Facebook advertising, visit our Business Help Center aricles and changelog:

Facebook SDK for iOS, App Events API and Mobile Measurement Partners Updates for Apple's iOS 14 Requirements
Facebook Pixel Updates for Apple's iOS 14 Requirements
January 19, 2021 - Breaking Changes

The agency_client_declaration field requires Admin privileges for all operations starting with v10.0 and will be required for all versions on May 25, 2021.

Ad Volume

You can view the volume of ads running or in review for your ad accounts. These ads will count against the ads limit per page that we will enact in early 2021. Query the number of ads running or in review for a given ad account.

Ad Limit Per Page enforcement begins for when a Page reaches its ad limit enforcement date. Enforcement date can be queried here.

When a Page is at its ad limit:

New ads (or ads scheduled to begin at that time) do not publish successfully.
Actions on existing ads are limited to pausing and archiving until the number of ads running or in review is below the ad limit.

To see the ads volume for your ad account:

curl -G 
  -d "access_token=<access_token>" 
  "https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/act_<ad_account_ID>/ads_volume"

The response looks like this:

{"data":[{"ads_running_or_in_review_count":2}]}

For information on managing ads volume, see About Managing Ad Volume.

Running Or In Review

To see if an ad is running or in review, we check effective_status, configured_status, and the ad account's status:

If an ad has effective_status of 1 - active, we consider it a running or in review.
If an ad has configured_status of active and effective_status of 9 - pending review, or 17 - pending processing we consider it a running or in review.
The ad can be running or in review only if the ad account status is in 1 - active, 8 - pending settlement, 9 - in grace period.

We also determine if an ad is running or in review based on the ad set's schedule.

If start time is before current time, and current time is before end time, then we consider the ad running or in review.
If start time is before current time and the ad set has no end time, we also consider it running or in review.

For example, if the ad set is scheduled to run in the future, the ads are not running or in review. However if the ad set is scheduled to run from now until three months from now, we consider the ads running or in review.

If you are using special ads scheduling features, such as day-parting, we consider the ad running or in review the whole day, not just for the part of the day when the ad starts running.

Breakdown By Actors

We’ve added the show_breakdown_by_actor parameter to the act_123/ads_volume endpoint so you can query ad volume and ad limits-related information for each page. For more details, see Breakdown by Actors.

Criando

To create a new ad account for your business you must specify name, currency, timezone_id, end_advertiser, media_agency, and partner. Provide end_advertiser, media_agency, and partner:

They must be Facebook Page Aliases, Facebook Page ID or an Facebook app ID. For example, to provide your company as an end advertiser you specify my company or 20531316728.

The End Advertiser ID is the Facebook primary Page ID or Facebook app ID. Further reference to this field (for formatting and acceptable values) may be found here.

If your ad account has no End Advertiser, Media Agency, or Partner, specify NONE.

If your ad account has an End Advertiser, Media Agency, or Partner, that are not represented on Facebook by Page or app, specify UNFOUND.

Once you set end_advertiser to a value other than NONE or UNFOUND you cannot change it.

Create an ad account:

curl \

-F "currency=USD" \
-F "timezone_id=1" \
-F "end_advertiser=<END_ADVERTISER_ID>" \
-F "media_agency=<MEDIA_AGENCY_ID>" \
-F "partner=NONE" \
-F "access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
"https://graph.facebook.com/<API_VERSION>/<BUSINESS_ID>/adaccount"
